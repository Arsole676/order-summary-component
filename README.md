## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS/SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

In this project i learned about practical UI development and usage of flexbox and box sahdows in various things.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="flexbox">My flex box</div>
```
```scss

/* SCSS COMPILED CODE*/

.flexbox {
  display: flex;
  position: absolute;
  -webkit-box-align: center;
      -ms-flex-align: center;
          align-items: center;
  -ms-flex-line-pack: center;
      align-content: center;
  -webkit-box-pack: center;
      -ms-flex-pack: center;
          justify-content: center;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  -webkit-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
          transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development

I will try my best to make wonderful websites like this and use this frontendmentor as my practice I really liked the challenges that I found here.

### Useful resources
